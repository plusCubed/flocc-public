# Flocc

A Clubhouse-like group call Electron app:
* Mesh P2P WebRTC with [Perfect Negotation](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#perfect-negotiation-example)
* YouTube music queue & player with syncing in each room
* Add/remove friends, easily jump in a room that a friend is in

(Excuse the code quality, this was a small side project I made during quarantine :P)
